## Linux command-line editing

Besides actually editing text files, the other tool I use that requires the most editing is the Bash shell. The default Bash editor is Emacs. Although I have used Emacs, I definitely prefer Vim. So many years ago, I switched the default editing style for Bash command-line editing from Emacs to Vim, which is much more comfortable for me.
 ```bash
 cd /home/`whoami`
 vi /home/`whoami`/.selected_editor
 ```
 ```bash
#add / replace
SELECTED_EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim.basic"
 ```
